<h1 align="center">😺 Hello There, I am Leonel Aguirre 😺</h1>

I am a 23-year-old web developer passionate about software development, since it allows me to model my ideas and achieve impressive results, my constant curiosity about how my environment works helps me to always keep learning new things. I consider myself as a person with the ability to adapt to new environments, identifying my areas of opportunity and work around them.
